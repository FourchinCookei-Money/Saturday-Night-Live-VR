# Ocean Stream NFT Unquie Market Platform

>Build Liquity from your NFT as you Showcase your Work on DeFi/ETH Platform, Linked with Keybase, Chainlinked

### Ocean Stream Keeper provides options for smart contracts to outsource regular maintenance tasks in a trust minimized and decentralized manner. The network aims to provide a protocol for incentivization and governance within the Keeper ecosystem.
## There are three main actors in the network:

- Client Contracts: Smart contracts that need external entities to service their maintenance tasks.
- Keepers: Chainlink nodes that execute registered Upkeeps.
- Registry: The contract through which anyone can create and manage Upkeeps, and node operators can perform Upkeeps.
The diagram below describes the architecture of the Keeper network. It is responsible for governing the actors on the network and compensating Keepers for performing successful Upkeeps.
Clients can register for Upkeep and node operators can register as Keepers.

### Each data feed is built and funded by the community of users who rely on accurate, up-to-date data in their smart contracts. As more users rely on and contribute to a data feed, the quality of the data feed improves. For this reason, each data feed has its own properties depending on the needs of its community of users.
